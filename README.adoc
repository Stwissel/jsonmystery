Experimenting with JSON Schema validation

== Purpose

Testing JSON submissions against JSON Schema. In a web context this isn't actually necessary,
since https://vertx-web-site.github.io/docs/vertx-web-openapi/java/[Vert.x OpenAPI] takes care of
it. So don't get distracted here, the purpose is to test JSON schema validation for JSON that
happened to come via a different path (e.g eventbus)

Supported endpoints:

- GET Just a message [/]
- POST a traffic light [/trafficlight]
- POST a street (contains traffic lights) [/street]

To launch your tests:
```
./mvnw clean test
```
